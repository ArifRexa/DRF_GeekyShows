Serializer Field
----------------
Serializer fields handle converting between primitive values and internal datatypes.
They also deal with validating input values, as well as retrieving and setting the
values from their parent objects.

Syntax:

from rest_framework import serializers
serializers.Field_Name( )


Example:

from rest_framework import serializers
serializers.CharField( )


===========================================================================================================================

CharField - A text representation. Optionally validates the text to be shorter than max_length and longer than min_length.

Syntax:- CharField(max_length=None, min_length=None, allow_blank=False,trim_whitespace=True)

● max_length - Validates that the input contains no more than this number of characters.

● min_length - Validates that the input contains no fewer than this number of characters.

● allow_blank - If set to True then the empty string should be considered a valid value. 
If set to False then the empty string is considered invalid and will raise a validation error.
Defaults to False.

● trim_whitespace - If set to True then leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed. Defaults to
True.

● The allow_null option is also available for string fields, although its usage is discouraged in
favor of allow blank.

Core Arguments
---------------

label - A short text string that may be used as the name of the field in HTML form fields or
other descriptive elements.

validators - A list of validator functions which should be applied to the incoming field input,
and which either raise a validation error or simply return. Validator functions should typically
raise serializers. ValidationError, but Django's built-in ValidationError is also supported for
compatibility with validators defined in the Django codebase or third party Django packages.

error_messages - A dictionary of error codes to error messages.
help_text - A text string that may be used as a description of the field in HTML form fields or
other descriptive elements.


initial - A value that should be used for pre-populating the value of HTML form fields.
style - A dictionary of key-value pairs that can be used to control how renderers should render
the field.

Example:
password = serializers.CharField(
    max_length=100,
    style={'input_type': 'password', 'placeholder': 'Password"})
